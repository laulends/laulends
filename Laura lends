Deciding to secure a payday loan requires a methodical approach by the borrower to determine whether or not it truly is the solution to your financial problem. Remember - a payday loan is a short-term, not long-term, solution to a financial emergency.

Here are 5 questions to ask yourself before completing a payday loan application:

1. Will I be able to pay off the loan in the given timeframe? Usually, lenders require borrowers to repay their loan when they receive their next paycheck, which is typically a two-week timeframe. Sometimes, lenders will require that you hand them a blank check for them to hold and they will deposit that check for the amount that you borrowed when the time comes. It is imperative that you not only have the funds available to repay your loan, but make sure you intend on actually repaying the loan, as not doing so will seriously hurt your ability to borrow again, not to mention drown you in further debt.
