If you have extremely bad credit and find yourself in a financial bind, one of the few kinds of financing you can turn to is payday loans. In recent years, it's become easier and easier to obtain payday loans, and more cash advance stores have popped up in the US than there are McDonald's and Starbucks combined. The money comes with no restrictions on it and can be obtained within minutes of filling out the application.

However, payday loans have a darker side. They should only be used as an emergency funding source when they are really needed, and should not replace fiscal responsibility or other means as a regular source of funds. If they do, you can end up in a trap and pay several hundred percent interest each year on small loans.
